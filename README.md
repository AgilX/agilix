[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AgilX/agilix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AgilX/agilix)

We believe that health services need a modern, free and open source collaborative tool based on [Agile Manifesto values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org).
We'd like it to be connected to medical devices and sensors.

Our initiative is based on a project born during the [Cooperathon](https://cooperathon.com) 2018 in France.

This very first release is based on [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech) project generation tool.
